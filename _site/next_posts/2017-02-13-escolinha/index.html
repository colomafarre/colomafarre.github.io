    <article class="post-content">
        <p>My goals from the beginning coming to Mozambique were very simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embrace the new culture and environment</li>
  <li>Learn Portuguese</li>
  <li>Volunteer as a teacher</li>
</ul>

<p>For the first 2 and a half months I have been doing a lot of the 2 first goals: practicing Portuguese with everybody I could, reading in Portuguese, meeting people, playing with mozambican kids, getting to know the city, trying mozabican food, etc.</p>

<p>But my plan to volunteer in a school was delayed until now because right when we got here they started summer holidays and school didn’t start again until 2 weeks ago. Then, I didn’t want to bother the teachers the first week of school, because I know how crazy those first days are! I did go and talk to the nuns that run the orphanage and “Escolinha” (their work for kindergarten). I told them I was interested in volunteering at the Escolinha to help the teachers with whatever they needed if I could take Ramona with me, and they were very thankful and happy with the idea.</p>

<p>It has been another wild adventure. Before visiting the school I tried to think a lot about what to expect, to be ready. I didn’t know much about the place but I knew I wanted to volunteer there because they had kids from 2 to 5 year old and that is where I have the most experience as a teacher and I though I would be able to help the most.</p>

<p>The first day me and Ramona when there at 9 am. We met the 2 teachers and the cleaning lady. They were really friendly and nice. And then there were the kids, more than 40 kids, from ages 2 (some I think they are not 2 yet…) to 5. The school is basically 2 long buildings with a covered middle space and a little playground next to it. On of the buildings is divided in 2 classrooms, one much bigger then the other. The other building is full of bunk beds.</p>

<p>Here is what a day at the Escolinha looks like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>7-8: drop off</li>
  <li>8-8:30: exercise and play time outside</li>
  <li>8:30: wash hands and go inside</li>
  <li>9-10: tea and bread for everyone</li>
  <li>10-10:30: free play</li>
  <li>10:30-11:30: circle time with songs and activities</li>
  <li>11:30: lunch</li>
  <li>12-14: Nap time</li>
  <li>14-15: free play</li>
  <li>15-16: pick up</li>
</ul>

<p>Ramona had fun. The first minutes were a little bit overwhelming for her because some kids wouldn’t stop touching her, especially her hair (they are obsessed with our hair here! The other day, walking in the street, somebody asked me if they could BUY my hair!). But after a while she was just doing her thing, having snack like the others (even though she found the tea to be too hot! It really was hot!), clapping hands with the songs, etc. So nice to see her interact and enjoy her “first day of school”.</p>

<p>After that we have gone several mornings again. My plan is to try to stay one full day to see how Ramona does nap there, see how it goes and decide how often we are going to go. It is so interesting to talk to the teachers there, they are very curios and ask me a lot of questions and I felt very welcomed and helpful from the beginning.</p>

<p>The things that have surprised me the most (aka things that are very different from a preschool in Spain or the USA):
- A lot of kids for only 2 teachers. (Apparently they are going to divide them in 2 groups soon, younger ones and older ones, and that will be more manageable and better for everyone).
- The only things they have are plastic tables and chairs, hangers for their backpacks, a black board in the big classroom and the bunk beds to nap. No toys. No art supplies. Nothing else…
- The rhythm. Like everything else in Mozambique, everything is kind of slow, they take their time to go from one activity to the other and the kids just play around, talk, chill and wait.
- Not a lot of organized educational activities.
- The bathrooms. I don’t want to talk much about it but just to have an idea, I couldn’t even go in to take a picture, the smell was too strong for me… And I understand why some of the kids prefer to pee behind the school..</p>
