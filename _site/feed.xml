Special because it’s going to be shorter than normal and I think that makes us enjoy it more! Fall is not usually my favorite season, but the fact that we’ll be moving to Mozambique in a few weeks (where summer is just around the corner) is making me want to savor every moment and feel every fall feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7091.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7091.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other weekend we did a little hike with our friends after a big lunch. We took a basket to collect “fall treasures” on the way. Hiking with toddlers is not the same as without them. The amount of time it takes to get from point A to point B is muuuccchh longer than it used to be. Stopping every few meters, taking more breaks, inexplicable melt-downs, falls, diaper changes, etc. But the slow speed really helps you to appreciate the little things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7088.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7088.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7082.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7082.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7076.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7076.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; She thought rocks were the coolest treasures to pick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7094.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7094.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So nice to spend time outside, with friends, seeing the world through Ramona’s eyes! She is now in a stage where she notices every little sound and detail and it’s so cute to see her reactions to new things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also starting to communicate more. She learned how to say “no”, for example, but she is not really using it right. Halfway through the hike I asked her if she wanted an apple and she emphatically said “no”. I gave it to her just in case and she didn’t let go of it for an hour! She nibbled on it all the way back home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7142.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7142.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more pictures of another beautiful fall day. Playing with the fallen leaves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After collecting our fall treasures, I arranged a little corner at home to display them so that Ramona can play with them. She loves throwing the chestnuts on the floor, as far as possible, and putting the little acorns inside their “hats”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7511.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/IMG_7511.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONG LIVE FALL!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/fall/throwing.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/fall/throwing.gif&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we wanted to share a video too! We made &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panellets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“panellets”&lt;/a&gt;, the typical Catalan dessert for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castanyada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“la Castanyada”&lt;/a&gt; and here is the process! We had a lot of fun making them. Ramona helped a lot (not really), but she at least entertained the bakers. Enjoy!!&lt;/p&gt;

Because everybody loves listening to good music. It is so nice to play music while cooking dinner, while folding laundry or to dance together. I don’t know if it happens to you too, but we realized that we were listening to the same music all the time. It’s like everything else, you get into a habit where you can’t think about different stuff to listen too. So we decided to do something about it and we created &lt;strong&gt;Two Song Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/20160916_151302-ANIMATION.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/20160916_151302-ANIMATION.gif&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is this: both Joe and I &lt;strong&gt;pick a song every Tuesday to share with the other&lt;/strong&gt;. It can be which ever song we like, we just discovered, or somebody told us it was good, or maybe we think the other person will like it, etc. The idea is to introduce to each other new songs from new singers or groups to make our play list grow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We normally “celebrate” Two Song Tuesday after Ramona is asleep, after we ate dinner and washed dishes and got our stuff ready for the next day. It’s kind of an end of the day hang out time. We lay down in bed, we connect the good speaker to our laptop and we listen to the chosen songs. Each Tuesday one of us goes first. We either explain something about the song, who it is from, why we chose it, etc., beforehand or sometimes we just listen to the song and then we can talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is such a nice feeling to lay down, close your eyes and just listen, listen to the music! Even if sometimes it’s hard for our minds to disconnect and not think about anything else but the sounds of the song, it’s a good practice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned 3 things (after only a few editions):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using good speakers makes a big difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second time you listen to a song it’s even better!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s very interesting to listen to the song first without watching a video, imagining what the singer will look like. You can get really surprised afterwards when you see they don’t look at all as you imagined (this happened to Joe with Lucas Graham. He imagined a big black guy, and, if you know him, he is not really any of those things).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made a &lt;strong&gt;play list&lt;/strong&gt; on our youtube channel. We will keep adding 2 songs after each 2ST edition. You can listen to it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_LrdiU6Jvx1suAecEdgfjuQDg7rYLxP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately for you, we have not trademarked Two Song Tuesday (yet). So, find someone you love, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, and enjoy the music.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Coloma Farré</name></author><summary>Today a post about music!

&lt;p&gt;We have sooo many photos and videos of this 1st year with our baby and it can get overwhelming when you try to look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like making short videos with music. We normally do it after our trips or vacations to sum up and make it easier to watch! I may post some others that we have soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;

One year being parents, learning from her and with her. We celebrated together with my family and some friends, having a picnic style party after walking/biking to this little church yard 30 minutes away from my hometown. Everybody brought something to snack on, we brought drinks and fruit, people got sweet gifts for her, kisses and love.

&lt;p&gt;I made her little birthday cake following a recipe from the blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fitmamarealfood.com/babys-first-smash-cake-healthy-no-sugar-banana-cake/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Fit mama real food”&lt;/a&gt;. Perfect banana cake without added sugar decorated with blueberries that Ramona really LOVED!!! She first ate all the blueberries and then dipped her fingers in the frosting! So sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made her birthday crown, with the help of my grandma (Ramona’s great grandma)! The cool thing about it is that the number is interchangeable so I will be able to use it for her next birthdays!&lt;/p&gt;

My husband had a work conference there and we took advantage of it to enjoy it as a family. I lived in Holland before, in 2009 during my Erasmus semester, in Utrecht, 20 minutes train ride from Amsterdam, and I loved it! I love the people there and the fact that everybody rides bikes everywhere!! It’s like a dream!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/amsterdam/20160922_150629.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/amsterdam/20160922_150629.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we stayed in an AirBnB in the Pijp neighborhood in Amsterdam. Such a cool place, we were very close to a big and beautiful park (Sarphatipark) with a really nice playground and lake with ducks. There were a lot of hip restaurants and stores and the Albert Cuypmarkt (the biggest and most popular outdoor market in the Netherlands) very close by too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did go to Utrecht for one afternoon to visit some friends that live there! It’s such a nice city, much more relaxed and calm than Amsterdam! We can’t decide which one we like better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loved the time there. It was great the fact that almost every restaurant or cafe was family friendly, with a little corner with wooden toys or books for the kids to play with! It was so fun to rent bikes and ride around the center with Ramona! She liked riding in front of the bike (in Barcelona her bike seat is behind Joe’s and I think she can’t see as much). It was funny buying baby food there and realizing how different they are, with ingredients that you’ll never find in Spanish baby food, like: beef+apples+beans, or fish+pasta+spinach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my favorite pictures of those days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great week! And we are even more excited because next year we will get to live for a while in Holland. Help us decide, should we choose, Utrecht or Amsterdam???&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Coloma Farré</name></author><summary>At the end of September we went for 5 days to Amsterdam. My husband had a work conference there and we took advantage of it to enjoy it as a family. I lived in Holland before, in 2009 during my Erasmus semester, in Utrecht, 20 minutes train ride from Amsterdam, and I loved it! I love the people there and the fact that everybody rides bikes everywhere!! It’s like a dream!</summary></entry><entry><title>First post.

Welcome to our blog. My name is Coloma. I’ll be writing most of the posts. Occasionally Joe, my husband, will too. This is a space we created to share things with all of you! Family, friends, people from here, people from over there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first language is Catalan. I decided to write in English so I could reach more of you! It will be good for me to keep improving my English and for those of you for whom English is not your first language either, this can be good practice too, right? We are always learning!! So forgive me if there are any mistakes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to share a little bit of our lives here. We thought it would be nice, since we are moving from country to country over the next few years (Mozambique, Spain, Holland), to be able to show you what it’s like to live there and how are things going for us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading! And please feel free to leave comments and tell us what you think about all this ;)&lt;/p&gt;
