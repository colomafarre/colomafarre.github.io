Joe, Ramona, me and Djer (our neighbor from across the street and Ramona’s best friend in Mozambique).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7680.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7680.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was a last minute plan&lt;/strong&gt;, and we were lucky to find a place to stay because most of the hotels were booked. &lt;strong&gt;It was also a last minute decision to take Djer with us&lt;/strong&gt;! He always talked about how he had never gone to the beach, how excited he was about to go one day, asking me to show him pictures of the beach, etc. So, on Saturday morning we talked to his mom and she agreed. He quickly packed his bag and join us for the trip! Ramona was so happy and entertained with him, and he was more than excited with the whole experience!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7686.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7686.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7695.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7695.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7696.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7696.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7690.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7690.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7744.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7744.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7746.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7746.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7757.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7757.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Djer had never had pizza before either&lt;/strong&gt;. Not that we needed an extra excuse to get some, but since there is no pizza place in Manhiça, and since Joe was almost as excited about it as Djer was about the beach, we searched out Bilene’s pizza joint. We ended up at a restaurant we really liked. It had great views, space for the kids to play, a big library with all sorts of books, a cool ambiance and yummy cheesy pizzas. Perfect evening with the ocean breeze!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7798.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7798.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7824.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7824.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7832.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7832.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we did more of the same: beach and pool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7936.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7936.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7938.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7938.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7945.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7945.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7952.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_7952.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back we stopped at this big street market to buy some fruit (no mangos!). So beautifully arranged that you just wanna buy everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_8005.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_8005.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_8006.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/bilene/0000_IMG_8006.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend was fun in so many ways: spending time with my family, a lovely beach, the perfect temperature, good food, nice people. Way too many mosquitoes at night, but nothing is perfect. &lt;strong&gt;It was especially good to be able to share it with our new friend&lt;/strong&gt;! To see him get so excited to be at the beach for the first time, jumping in the water with the biggest smile, making up a “pizza” song while waiting for dinner to be ready… All those emotions and excitement that sometimes, as adults, we forget… kids make us realize and appreciate more. The good things in life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is a short &lt;strong&gt;video of the trip&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Mozambique style</title><link href="http://familyonthego.life/capulana/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to carry a baby.

And, even though on Sunday most of the stands are not open, we found a sweet mom of an 11 month old that was willing to show me how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_20161201_115337.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_20161201_115337.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use these big and colorful fabrics called “&lt;strong&gt;capulanas&lt;/strong&gt;”. They are used for so many things here: to wear as a skirt, to carry things around, and especially to carry babies! They are fantastic, strong, come in so many different colors and patterns and that’s what you see all women wearing all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_8792.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_8792.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_20161206_170206.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_20161206_170206.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_20161209_084505.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_20161209_084505.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And to carry baby dolls!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept seeing all the moms carrying babies like this, no strollers at all! Young babies but also little kids, being carried around with just a cloth and a knot. I carry Ramona most of the time with the Boba Baby carrier which I find very comfortable for both of us, but I felt like I needed to try the Mozambican way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5632.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5632.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ramona tried it out before me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am so happy I did. This mom was so nice! We asked if we could take a video and she agreed. We had a big audience! A lot of other women looking at the process and laughing (especially when the back of my dress got tucked under the capulana).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5666.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5666.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was easier to set up and more comfortable to wear than I expected&lt;/strong&gt;! I do have to say that after a while it was a bit less comfortable. I think that with a smaller baby it would be much easier and more practical. Ramona is getting so big! Even I got surprised when I saw the pictures afterwards. Wow, I have a huge toddler, not a baby anymore!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5673.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5673.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5691.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5691.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The good thing too is that you can slide her to the side and wear her on the hip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5720.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/capulana/0000_IMG_5720.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I feel like &lt;strong&gt;it was a great experience&lt;/strong&gt;! To realize that you only need a big cloth to have free hands while taking care of your baby! And now every time I see a mom carrying her baby I know how that feels and I feel more connected to them! It may sound silly but it is part of learning a new culture, living in a new place, trying their ways of living!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here a short video tutorial! I hope you like it!&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll share with you what our day to day looks like here. I am sure it’s going to change with time but for now this is what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wake up around 6-6:30 every morning, more than an hour after sunrise! Ramona too, &lt;strong&gt;she sleeps through the night, most nights (yoohoo!!)&lt;/strong&gt;. At 6:30 we meet with our friend Andrew and maybe somebody else that wants to join for a 30 minute run. One day Joe goes, the other day I go! Then Monday, Wednesday and Friday we do our family workout in the yard (soon a post about that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161207_074055.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161207_074055.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before breakfast I collect the ~30 mangos that fall from the trees during the night. &lt;strong&gt;Breakfast&lt;/strong&gt; consists of either oatmeal, cereal or french toast, plus fruit (mango, yummy little bananas or apple) and coffee for us and milk for Ramona. Joe goes to work around 7:30-8, which is a 3 minute walk from home. Me and Ramona go out to the market to buy whatever we need for lunch and we run errands, before it gets too hot. These days it’s pretty hot at 9 in the morning already though!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161124_132552.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161124_132552.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; She is such a good helper!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161207_085123.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161207_085123.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days a week Nati comes in the morning to help us around the house. Nati is what they call here, a &lt;strong&gt;“empregada”&lt;/strong&gt;. As a foreign family living here the expectation is to hire a woman to help with the house, mostly to wash clothes since there are no washing machines here. She is very sweet with Ramona and does an amazing job washing clothes by hand! I don’t know what we would do without her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161128_092814.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161128_092814.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe comes home for &lt;strong&gt;lunch&lt;/strong&gt; around 12. We normally eat all together. Then Ramona takes a nap, Joe goes back to work and I work on the blog, study Portuguese, read, etc. Those are the hottest hours, even inside the house (we don’t have A/C, only 2 fans) some days it’s so hot that you don’t feel like doing anything. So it’s nice that it coincides with Ramona’s nap time! She sleeps for about 2 hours or so. Then we play in the house, read books, paint, have a snack, etc. until about 4-4:30 when it starts to cool down and we go out in the yard or the street to play outside!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161128_144408.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161128_144408.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161201_151041.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161201_151041.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161207_111218.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161207_111218.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161129_173051.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161129_173051.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_IMG_9994.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_IMG_9994.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, &lt;strong&gt;the neighbors across the street have become very good friends with Ramona&lt;/strong&gt;! They love to play with her and she loves when they come over! They have these cool cars they built themselves and they let her play with them. Ramona shares her sand toys and her books with them. It’s a win win situation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/car.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/car.gif&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161129_173316.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161129_173316.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 6 pm Antonio comes to our place. Antonio is &lt;strong&gt;our guard/gardener&lt;/strong&gt;. Like I said about the “empregada”, it is also the expectation to have a night guard, for security. It is not that we live in a very dangerous neighborhood but it is true that there are some thefts, and, because we have such a big yard, it’s very useful for us to have somebody that takes care of it. He rakes all the leaves and does a very good job keeping the yard nice and clean! Ramona loves him too, he is such a nice and happy person. He stays until 6 the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_IMG_0036.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_IMG_0036.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Antonio’s family came over for dinner one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have &lt;strong&gt;dinner&lt;/strong&gt; around 8 pm, with Ramona. She eats the same stuff we eat lately (I will write more about food in another post), which makes it easier and fun to share meals together. She takes a bath, Joe reads her a story and goes to bed before 9 pm. We try to go to sleep before 11 pm but you know how it is… there’s always something we want to do or somebody we want to hang out with! We always sleep under the mosquito net, Ramona too. It’s very important here to prevent mosquito bites and therefore malaria and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161202_124850.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/img/lifehere/0000_20161202_124850.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody asked &lt;strong&gt;what we do for fun&lt;/strong&gt;. So far, what we enjoy the most is to go on walks, explore different parts of town, go to the street markets (there are a lot of them) and do stuff with friends. We are so lucky that there’s already this big community of foreigners, mostly Joe’s colleagues, that has included us in their activities (dinners, yoga, weekend trips, …) from day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody else asked &lt;strong&gt;how we get around&lt;/strong&gt;. We mostly walk everywhere! Joe’s work is one block away, the “fancy” bakery is 5 minutes away and the closest market is about 10 minute walk, for example. Ramona walks for a while, then I carry her in my arms or on my back with the baby carrier, no strollers here. Some streets are paved but some are just sand! When we need to buy water, bigger or more stuff we take a tuk-tuk (a kind of small 3 wheeled taxi, that Ramona loves, I don’t know why!). And soon we will have a car!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I think that’s enough for today! I hope you got an idea of what our days look like in Mozambique! So many things are so different from life before, but it all seems so normal now!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Coloma Farré</name></author><summary>After 3 weeks living Mozambique I think we kind of have a routine.

&lt;p&gt;This past weekend some friends invited us to go to &lt;strong&gt;Zongoene Lodge&lt;/strong&gt;, about 3 hours north of Manhiça. First it sounded like too much for a weekend with a baby, but we are so happy we went. It was great! Relaxing, swimming, eating good food and enjoying time with our new friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a special place situated where the river meets the sea. The second half of the trip there was all on extremely bumpy, unpaved roads which passed through several tiny villages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived there Friday evening. We were a big group so we stayed in different little houses. Ours was the big one so that we could hang out at night together with our friends while having Ramona sleep close enough to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0161.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0161.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0165.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0165.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning activities: exploring nature, walking to the river, discovering new plants and animals, and pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0168.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0168.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0243.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0243.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0256.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0256.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And the birdies like it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0262.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0262.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So many beautiful birds, and so hard to photograph them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we took a family nap (the best!) and then there was a little boat waiting to take us to the other side of the river, to this beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0282.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0282.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a place! &lt;strong&gt;It was like being on a different planet&lt;/strong&gt;! So cool! So different than what I had imagined! Big, open, super windy beach! In order to protect us from the wind, we made a little fort with our stuff and a big log. We walked around looking for shells, we kept some to make a mobile for Ramona’s room (like the one in her favorite bed time story book, “Ten, night, eight”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0296.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0296.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the best was when we walked all the way to the water, there was a drop-off so you couldn’t see it until you were very close but, at the shore there were crabs, &lt;strong&gt;so many crabs&lt;/strong&gt;! It was magical!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0367.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0367.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0332.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0332.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0352.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0352.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here they are, &lt;strong&gt;jumping pictures&lt;/strong&gt; are back! I use to take them all the time, I don’t know what happened, but in case you missed them… ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0396.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0396.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Mama jumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0411.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0411.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Papa jumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0426.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0426.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And Ramona “jumps”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0576.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0576.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sky there was amazing&lt;/strong&gt;! So many stars! Even the moon looked gorgeous! It was the first time we saw the moon since we moved to Mozambique and Ramona got all excited! She even says “lluna” (moon in Catalan) now, kind of! And every time she sees a star now she wants us to sing “Twinkle twinkle little star” (to which she dances), so imagine how many times we sang it this weekend!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0623.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0623.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday we spent the day doing more of the same, exploring, snacking, chilling, swimming and relaxing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0629.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0629.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0635.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0635.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0644.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0644.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0737.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0737.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back &lt;strong&gt;it was amazing to see the landscapes around&lt;/strong&gt;. On the way there it was so dark that we couldn’t see anything. But on the way back we could see all sorts of animals, tiny villages with kids playing, moms cooking outside, little markets, small bars with men hanging out. Very entertaining and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0752.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0752.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0766.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0766.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramona slept for half of the trip (just like on the way there) on our lap. We stopped half way in a big street market to buy vegetables, fruits and yummy roasted cashews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0763.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/zongoene/IMG_0763.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zongone is a great place to go either with family or with friends (or with both, like we did), very kid friendly, to relax but also with fun stuff to do. Some of our friends rented 4X4s to go to the lighthouse and they said it was very cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you had a nice weekend too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Coloma Farré</name></author><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>What to do when you have too many mangos</title><link href="http://familyonthego.life/mangos/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What to do when you have too many mangos" /><published>2016-11-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-11-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://familyonthego.life/mangos</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://familyonthego.life/mangos/">&lt;p&gt;What should you do &lt;strong&gt;if you have way too many mangos&lt;/strong&gt;? That may not be a problem you had before or will ever have, and I am telling you that I never had this issue before in my life either. But, right now, that is our situation: a big yard with 5 huge mango trees and now it’s mango season, so, that means we have about 100 mangos a day (that is Joe’s estimation)!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what we do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First of all, be careful! Mangos are actually pretty heavy. If you happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, you may get hurt. Even Ramona has learned to say &lt;strong&gt;“boom”&lt;/strong&gt; every time a mango hits the ground, which is pretty often!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collect mangos every morning and throughout the day and &lt;strong&gt;select the good ones&lt;/strong&gt; (there’s a lot that are half eaten by birds, etc), wash them and stick them in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/20161123_085037.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/20161123_085037.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mangos all day long&lt;/strong&gt;. For breakfast, for dessert and for snack!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9301.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9301.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We give some to our &lt;strong&gt;neighbors&lt;/strong&gt; across the street. But then they give us some back because they have a different kind of tree that makes very good mangos too! So we end up with same amount or more!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9942.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9942.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The 3 different kind of mangos we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every once in a while there are &lt;strong&gt;kids&lt;/strong&gt; coming in the yard to ask if they can pick up some mangos. “Yes!!” The other day, 2 came in to ask and the moment I said “yes” there were like 6 more that came in, they started climbing the trees and throwing rocks to make the mangos fall! It was amazing how good they were at it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/20161129_154112.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/20161129_154112.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We will bring some as gifts for &lt;strong&gt;friends&lt;/strong&gt; or when people invite us over for dinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9295.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9295.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought about making &lt;strong&gt;dried mango&lt;/strong&gt; but then I read that you have to use the oven for 1 or 2 hours and our house is hot enough these days… Maybe if there’s a cooler day I will try…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I made &lt;strong&gt;mango jam&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/result.gif&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/result.gif&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never made jam before, but I decided I wanted to make some so I called my mom for advice and I did. Without following any specific recipe, without measuring the ingredients, I just improvised a little bit and it turned out quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/20161125_163711.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/20161125_163711.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s hard to say, because I’ve never tried mango jam before either so I don’t have anything with which to compare it … But the whole family enjoyed it for breakfast with some french toast and both Joe and Ramona approved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/20161126_074741.jpg.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/20161126_074741.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9841.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mangos/IMG_9841.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the plan is to make more jam soon. Any other ideas? :P&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Coloma Farré</name></author><summary>What should you do if you have way too many mangos?

Here we are, after more than a week living in Mozambique now we can say we like it here. Even if, like the tittle of the post says, this is a totally different world, &lt;strong&gt;we will be happy here&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/differentworld/IMG_8812.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/differentworld/IMG_8812.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where to start. One of the first things we’ve noticed is the pace, the rhythm, &lt;strong&gt;everything is kind of slower&lt;/strong&gt;. People are not in a rush, they know how to wait and how to do nothing. This is really shocking, coming form a society where we are always running from one thing to another, with a super long to do list, with no time to relax, just work. I feel like here people walk slower, they talk slower, they take their time to ask how are you and how is your family before asking whatever they need. You can see, when it’s really hot, for example, people sitting under the shade of a tree taking a break, just watching the others walk by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m not used to it, I sometimes find myself feeling annoyed, thinking “come on, people!”. But at the same time it’s kind of nice and it helps us to take it easy too. And it’s especially good with a baby. Ramona is at an age where she loves exploring and it’s so good for her that we can give her the time to observe and to take it all in. &lt;strong&gt;I think it’s a very good skill to learn, to slow down&lt;/strong&gt;, and this place is really helping us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/differentworld/20161120_180140.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/differentworld/20161120_180140.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather is another thing that effects us a lot here too. We are currently in spring. It’s going to get much hotter!! The temperatures now goes from around 36℃ (97°F) during the day to 21℃ (70°F) at night. There have been some really hot days when it’s already humid and nasty at 10 in the morning, but then it normally cools down in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been some rainy days too, where it’s raining almost all day, but it’s nice because when the rain stops the temperature is really perfect out. So &lt;strong&gt;I am trying to organize our days according to the weather&lt;/strong&gt; a little bit, going out in the yard early in the morning, playing in the house midday and going back out to explore before the mosquitoes in the evening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/differentworld/IMG_8779.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/differentworld/IMG_8779.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunrise now is at 4:50 in the morning!! 4:50, people!! That means we’ve been up by 5 several times, because our baby doesn’t know that she should still be sleeping, because it’s bright outside and our curtains are not thick enough! Not fun… we keep saying that we need to go to bed earlier, like they do here, but it’s been hard… &lt;strong&gt;We still need to work on adjusting our schedules&lt;/strong&gt; a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much more I wanna share and I have a few posts in mind. But I would also love to know, what are you wondering? &lt;strong&gt;Which questions do you want yo ask us about all this?&lt;/strong&gt; I will love to hear them and I will try to answer them in the following posts ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a very good friend of ours, &lt;strong&gt;Andrew, just moved here too&lt;/strong&gt;!! And he is sharing his experience on his blog. So if you wanna see Manhiça from another point of view, go check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://pieroginomicon.rocks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, and a &lt;strong&gt;video&lt;/strong&gt; of some moments of the first few days around town.&lt;/p&gt;

Can’t you believe it? Time is funny this way! It feels like so much has happened in our lives and it even seems more than a year ago some how… &lt;strong&gt;That was our first big trip as a family of 3&lt;/strong&gt;. The first time Ramona traveled out of the country, first time taking a plane, and it really was a challenge for us but we did have a great time!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mexic/20151114_161004.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mexic/20151114_161004.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were in Mexico for 10 days. We used AirBnB as our main source of accommodation, and we also stayed with friends a couple of nights. We spent one night in Playa del Carmen, 2 nights in the island of Cozumel, 4 nights in Tulum, 2 nights with some old friends on the cute island of Isla Mujeres and the list night before flying in Cancun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mexic/20151116_104021.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mexic/20151116_104021.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/mexic/20151116_111239.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/mexic/20151116_111239.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was amazing, everywhere we went. It was very easy to find little restaurants with typical Mexican food with handmade tortillas and fresh fish. I tried to avoid salads and fresh salsa but Joe went all out and we never got sick. &lt;strong&gt;Ramona was still exclusively breastfeeding so it was very easy with her&lt;/strong&gt;, but she did try a little bit of guacamole one day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the days walking around town, going to the beach early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the heat, taking naps at the house, having early dinners and talking about the future and life once Ramona was already asleep. &lt;strong&gt;We traveled light, one backpack each&lt;/strong&gt;. We packed clothes for half the trip, diapers for the first 2 days, 2 toys for Ramona. We did laundry twice, we bought more diapers there, she played with kitchen stuff. I gave away most of Ramona’s clothes at the end of the trip because we wouldn’t need summer clothes anymore anyway. Ramona slept with us because we didn’t bring a travel crib. She took naps in the bus on our lap, in the taxi in my arms, on a blanket at the beach, etc… We carried her in the Baby Bjorn carrier, facing out while she was awake, facing in to take naps. We didn’t need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to realize that we didn’t need to have much with us to have fun and have nice days with a baby! At home we have so much stuff. When you travel, you realize that you don’t need that much. &lt;strong&gt;You do your life with what you have and it’s a great thing to learn&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the pictures we took and also a video of the trip at the end of the post!&lt;/p&gt;

We made it!</title><link href="http://familyonthego.life/me-made-it/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Settling in Manhiça. We made it!" /><published>2016-11-18T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-11-18T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://familyonthego.life/me-made-it</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://familyonthego.life/me-made-it/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8678.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8678.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it! After about 20 hours of traveling (1 car ride, 2 flights and 2 different vans) we made it to our Mozambican town, Manhiça.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8669.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8669.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All the stuff!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trip went much better than I anticipated! Everything that could go well did. First of all, while checking luggage we thought we would need to pay for an extra suitcase but apparently we could check 2 suitcases each! So we rearranged our stuff to have less carry on, which made our trip much easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8635.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8635.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramona did great! She did have a little fever in the morning the day we left but later she was feeling much better. And, like we say in Spanish, “no hay mal que por bien no venga” (“every cloud has a silver lining”, more or less). It’s not that I like for her to be sick, but the fact that she was a little bit off made her relaxed and helped her to fall asleep more easily in the plane. The other great thing was that in the long flight (10h 15min from Lisbon to Maputo) the plane was not full, more like half full, so we had 5 seats in a row for the 3 of us, which made it much easier for us to sleep (or at least for Ramona).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8643.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8643.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is our second day in our new home! We are settling down, unpacking, we went grocery shopping yesterday, we still need to buy stuff for the house, but we are mostly set! The house is very simple but perfect for us! Big living room / dinning room area, kitchen with all the basics, 2 bedrooms and a bathroom with a big shower. And the best thing is that we have a huge front yard full of trees (mostly mango trees) and sand with which Ramona loves to play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8710.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8710.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ramona in front of our house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8687.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8687.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a hard day though. When we got the the house it didn’t have running water, the fridge had an incompatible South African plug, half of the lights in the house were off, some mosquito screens in the windows needed fixing, etc. So we spent all morning figuring out things, waiting for the electrician, going to the CISM (Centro de investigação em saude de Maniça where Joe works,) to use its fridge to store Ramona’s antibiotics, buying a new sim card for my phone, … In the afternoon we went on a walk and to the big supermarket to buy a big load of stuff! But I think everything is coming in to place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8704.JPG&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/madeit/IMG_8704.JPG&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first impressions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hotter than I expected (I have to say also that yesterday was an especially hot day for the season) but I was miserable in the sun, sweating so much and thinking “and this is only spring!?!”. But fortunately, last night it rained and today we woke up with a much cooler and breezier day and I am very thankful for that!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Greener than I expected! All the vegetation looks so green and alive! I kept thinking “any moment I will see a wild animal walking around or something!”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not handling very well the driving on the left side thing yet!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can understand people here less that I thought I would…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amazed by women walking around with big stuff on their heads like nothing at all. And kids running around barefoot with big smiles on their faces!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment: I’ve killed way to many spiders already. But again, mangos falling from the trees!! I guess I can’t complain… ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Coloma Farré</name></author><summary></summary></entry><entry><title>We are ready to go!!</title><link href="http://familyonthego.life/ready/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We are ready to go!!" /><published>2016-11-15T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2016-11-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://familyonthego.life/ready</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://familyonthego.life/ready/">&lt;p&gt;We are ready! Ready to go! Ready for the big move! To a new country. To a new continent. The three of us. Together. The big adventure starts tomorrow. Flying to Lisbon and then Maputo. All night in the air, hopefully sleeping…(with a sick baby…, with a UT infection! Think about us and send us all your positive thoughts, we will need them…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/IMG_20161112_084745.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Caption goes here&quot; src=&quot;/img/IMG_20161112_084745.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very much excited and a little bit scared. Excited for new adventures, new house, new friends, new opportunities and places. To be able to live immersed in a totally different culture, learn what being a mother is over there, learn what toddlers eat and play with. I love imagining how our lives are going to be. We haven’t even seen our place! It is so crazy to move to a new place knowing so little, but at the same time it is really exciting! Joe has been there twice this year, so he knows people there and he feels like we are going to really like it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;strong&gt;like every big change in life, this one comes with worries&lt;/strong&gt;. And I am amazed how different the situation is now that I have a baby! All my worries focus on Ramona! I don’t know how she is going to adapt to the new house and routines. If we are going to find food that she likes and enough variety to offer her a healthy diet. I am worried about her getting sick. And how is she going to deal with another new language (they speak Portuguese there, which I haven’t been practicing enough and that makes me worry too…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are we going to do there? It’s not like Barcelona where we are used to going to the park every day, meeting other moms with toddlers in family friendly cafes, taking the metro to meet some friends, doing the laundry in our washing machine, … &lt;strong&gt;There will be none of those things&lt;/strong&gt; in Manhiça, Mozambique. Everything will be different! And that sounds awesome but terrifying too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, down deep in my heart, I know everything is going to be OK, I really think so. And I am excited to be able to share it with you all!&lt;/p&gt;
