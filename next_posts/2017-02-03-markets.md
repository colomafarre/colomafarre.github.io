Write a post comparing the experience of shopping in Spain vs. Mozambique.
The positives (in Spain you have consistency, cold stuff, fresh stuff, variety; in Mozambique you have human interaction, the seller is also the grower, etc.).
And the negatives (negotiating, haggling, lack of availability, quality, etc.).
You can also make a cool video of lots of market stuff (including yesterday). And lots of cool photos.
