This post is a little bit embarrassing for me but my husband thought it was a good idea and he insisted that I write it, and he normally has good ideas, so, here we go.

Two years ago, when we were living in Gainesville, I was working at a Waldorf school, and for my birthday, one of my colleagues, got me some watercolor paints and paper. Every week at school the students would paint and I really liked their creations, so I decided to start painting too.

I started trying, practicing different techniques, painting little drawings and framing them, some for our house, some as gifts for friends. It was really fun and such a creative way to spend my free time! I loved it and I wish I had more time to learn more, but for the moment, it's just fun to play with the paints and create. Just create. It's relaxing and fulfilling for me!

Here are some of the paintings we have around the house now:

I hope you liked it! And I encourage you to do it, do more of what makes you happy. Maybe it's painting, maybe it's reading, whatever it is.

Joe and I have a project in mind that will involve some watercolor painting! I am really excited about it but scared at the same time, and I'll tell you more about it soon! ;D
