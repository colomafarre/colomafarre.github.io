This fall is special for us. Special because it's gonna be shorter than normal and I think that makes us enjoy it more! Fall is not my favorite season (it might even be my less favorite, but it is Joe's favorite!) but this year I feel like I am even enjoying the rainy days! Thinking that in 15 days we will be back to summer weather makes us wanna exprimir every moment and feel every fall feeling!

Last weekend we did a little hike with our friends after a big lunch. We took a basket to collect "fall treasures" on the way. Hiking with toddlers is not the same as before. Stopping every few meters, taking more breaks, but it really is nice to help you apreciate the little things.

So nice to spend time outside, with people you like, seeing the worlds trough Ramona's eyes! She is now in a stage where she notices every little sound and detail and it's so cute to see her reactions to new things!

She is also starting to communicate more. She learned how to say "no" but she is not really using it right. Half way on the hike I asked her if she wanted an apple and she said "no". I gave it to her to make sure and she didn't let go of it for an hour! She nibbled on it all the way back home!

After collecting our fall treasures, I arrenged a little corner at home to display them and that Ramona can play with the different stuff. She loves to trough the chestnuts on the floor, as far as possible and put the little acorns inside their head.

And finally, we wanted to share a video too! We made panellets, the typical Catalan dessert for la Castanyada and here is the process! Enjoy!!
