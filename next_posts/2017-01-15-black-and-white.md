Living in Mozambique it's being such a great adventure for the whole family. We are liking it and enjoying it but it is not easy all the time. It has it's ups and downs, it's things that are better and things that are worse, compared to our Barcelona life, for example.

I wanted to share with you a little list I've written about great things and not that good things about living in Mozambique. So you can see that is not black or white, there are some grey spots, some things I love from here and some things I hate.

Let's start with the good things:
- People are nice, really nice! Very open, curious, friendly and with big smiles.
- A lot of life happens outside, in the street (markets, play time,hang out time, ...). That's very nice for us because it makes it much easy to connect with people.
- Contact with nature. We live in a city but it feels like a town: no tall buildings, lot's of palm trees, very green, sandy roads, chickens running in the street, ... Not what you would imagine for a city.
- Simplicity of life. It feels like people do more with less here. They don't have much but they are fine. Even for us it's been this way.
- Birds singing every morning and all day long. That's what you hear when you step outside of the door. Rosters, birds, kids playing, no cars.
- People selling peanuts and popcorn in the street. I love popcorn, and to find a little popcorn stand in the main road that sells fresh made popcorn is my dream! So when I need a snack that's what I try to find, either popcorn or this kids that sell little bags of perfectly toasted peanuts for 5 or 10 cents. Yummy!

But there are some bad things too:
- Power goes out almost every day. Some times for 5 minutes, sometimes for a few hours. And it's not that bad but that means no fan (and during the day, when is hot, which is basically everyday, we survive because of the air of the fans!!) and no running water (because the water...).
- The heat. It can't be really bad. Like 40°C/104°F. Where you feel like melting if you walk out in the sun, you feel like sickly feverish. It's a weird feeling when the outside temperature is higher than you body temperature. It feels wrong. And the think is it wouldn't be that bad if this was Europe or the States because you would have A/C almost everywhere but not here... You just feel like doing nothing and very slow...
- Having to wear sunscreen during the day and mosquito repellent in the evening if we are out. I got use to carrying it around and "untar" Ramona before getting out of the house! I think "If we were in a cold place we would have to put 10 layers of clothes on and that would take longer...". But at least the close you don't need a shower to take of...
- Not a big variety of food. When you go to the market...
- Profalaxis
- mosquitos
- Tap water
- mosquito net sleep
- hard to find normal stuff
- entertainment variety,
- language
