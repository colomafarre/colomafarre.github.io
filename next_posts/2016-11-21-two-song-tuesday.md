Today a post about music! Because everybody loves listening to good music. It is so nice to play music while cooking dinner, while Ramona plays and I fold laundry or to dance together. But, I don't know if it happens to you too, but we realized that we were listening to the same music all the time. Is like everything else, you get into a habit where you can't think about different stuff to listen too. So we decided to do something about it and we created **Two Song Tuesday**.

So, the idea is, that both Joe and I have to **pick a song for every Tuesday to share with the other**. It can be which ever song we like, we just discovered, or somebody told us it was good, or maybe we think the other person will like, etc. But the idea is to introduce to each other to new songs from new singers or groups to make our playlist bigger!

We normally "celebrate" Two Song Tuesday after Ramona is asleep, after we ate dinner and washed dishes and got our stuff ready for the next day. Is kind of an end of the day hang out time. We lay down in bed, we connect the good speaker to our laptop and we listen to the chosen songs. Each Tuesday on of us goes first. We either explain something about the song, who is it from, why did we chose it, etc, before hand or sometimes we just listen to the song and then we can talk about it.

It is such a nice feeling to just lay down, close you eyes and just listen, listen to the music! Even if sometimes it's hard for our minds to disconnect and not think about anything else but the sounds of the song, it's a good practice!

We've learned 2 things (after only a few editions of '2ST'):
- The second time you listen to a song it's even better
- It's very interesting to listen to the song first without watching a video, imaging what the singer will look like. You can get really surprised afterwards when you see they don't look at all as you imagined (like it happened to Joe with Lucas Graham. He imagined a big black guy, and, if you know him, he is not really any of those things)

We made a **playlist** in our Youtube Cannel. We will keep adding 2 songs after each 2ST edition ;) You can listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz_LrdiU6Jvx1suAecEdgfjuQDg7rYLxP" target="_blank">here.</a>

We really encourage you to do it! It's fun! WOuld you try it?
