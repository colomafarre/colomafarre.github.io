I am from Santa Coloma de Queralt, a tiny town in the middle of Catalonia, Spain. I am an early childhood teacher and educational psychologist, working as a full time mom now. I like to spend time outside, paint watercolors, learn new skills, travel and hang out with my family and friends.

Joe is American, born in Gainesville, Florida. He is an epidemiologist, doing his PhD in malaria eradication. He likes running, biking, data, kebabs, and photography. But mostly kebabs.

We met in Granada in 2012. We traveled together to different places (Turkey, Portugal, Ethiopia, France, ...). We got married on May  2013. On July that same year we moved to Gainesville, Florida, where Ramona was born, on May 29th, 2015.

We are currently in Santa Coloma de Queralt, after spending 6 months in Amsterdam, and before that, 6 months in Mozambique where Joe was doing research on malaria economics. Galileo was born on January 21st, 2018, becoming like this a family of 4.
