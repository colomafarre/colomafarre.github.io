I am from Santa Coloma de Queralt, a tiny town in the middle of Catalonia, Spain. I am an early childhood teacher and educational psychologist, working as a Waldorf teacher. I like to spend time outside, paint watercolors, learn new skills, travel and hang out with my family and friends.

We met in Granada in 2012. We traveled together to different places (Turkey, Portugal, Ethiopia, France, ...). We got married on May 2013. On July that same year we moved to Gainesville, Florida, where Ramona was born, on May, 2015.
