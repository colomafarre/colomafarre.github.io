Like the song says: **"It's begining to look a lot like Cristmas...!!"** Well, here not really yet, but we are getting closer to December. And because time flies lately, I have started thinking about advent calendar ideas. **Maybe you too!?** I want to share some of the ideas I have in my head that may be useful to create your own personal advent calendar at home! 

<a href="/img/advent/0000_IMG_7102.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/advent/0000_IMG_7102.JPG" width="200"></a>(The pictures from this post are from last year, which explains my big baby bump and Ramona looking so small!)

Last year was the first time **we introduced this tradition in our family**! Ramona was 2 and a half and she was begining to understand the anticipation and liked the tradition of opening a little something every morning! So this year we are repeting!

**To create my advent calendar I used**:

- A wodden branch
- String and scisors
- Envelops, wrapping paper and tape
- A black pen
- And a bunch of ideas (that I am going to share with you here!)

You don't need much to make **a beautiful and fun activitiy for the whole family** that will guide you from December 1st all the way to Christmas day! There are very different kinds of advent calendars (<a href="https://www.pinterest.es/cfarrlpez/advent-calendar/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is full of good ideas, and that's where I found my inspiration last year). This year I wanna try to creat a cloth one that we can use every year, but we'll see if I have time to make it!!

So, 3 steps:
 1. Decide what you want to use to make your advent calendar 
 2. Decide what kind of surprises will be in it, and
 3. Find a good time every day to open them. 

It doesn't have to be gifts or material stuff. It can also be activities to do together as a family, for example. Some people wrap 24 wintery/chrismy books and they open one each day to read! Last year we did **a mix of small presents, books and family adventures** and we opened them every morning after breakfast.

So here are my ideas, more than 24, so you can chose the ones that suit your family best!

- Books: there are so many good books about winter and Christmas, and there's no such thing as too many books. Ramona's favorites for this season are: "The Tomten"  by Astrid Lindgren, "The snowman" by Raymond Briggs, and "Little lost angel" by Janet Field Heath.

What do you think? Are you going to do an advent calendar at home? Is this somehting your family did growing up? Actually, here in Catalonia it was not really a tradition before (it's a German tradition) but I think is a good one to adopt!!
