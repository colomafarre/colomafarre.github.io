Like the song says: **"It's begining to look a lot like Cristmas...!!"** Well, here not really yet, but we are getting closer to Desember. And because time flies lately, I have started thinking about the advent calendar ideas.** Maybe you too!?** I want to share some of the ideas I have in my head that may be useful to create your own personal advent calendar at home!

Last year was the first time **we introduced this tradition in our family**! Ramona was 2 and a half and she was begining to understand the anticipation and liked the tradition of opening a little something every morning! So this year we are repeting!

Last year, **to create my advent calendar I used**:

- A wodden branch
- String
- Envelops, wrapping paper and tape
- A black pen
- And  bunch of ideas (that I am going to share with you here!)

You don't need much to make **a beuatiful and fun activitiy for the whole family** that will guide you from December 1st all the way to Christmas day! There are very different kind of advent calendars (<a href="https://www.pinterest.es/cfarrlpez/advent-calendar/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> is full of good ideas, and that's where I found my inspiration last year). This year I wanna try to creat a cloth one that we can use every year, but we'll see if I have time to make it!!

So, 3 steps:
 1. Decide what do you want to use to make your advent calendar 
 2. Decide what kind of surprises will be in it, and
 3. Find a good time every day to open them. 

 It doesnt't have to be gifts or material stuff. It can also be activities to do together as a family, for exmple. Some people wrap 24 wintery/chrismy books and they open one each day to read! Last year we did **a mix of small presents, books and family adventures** and we opened them every morning after breakfast.

So here are my ideas, more than 24, so you can chose the ones that suit your family best!

What do you think? Are you going to do an advent calendar at home? Is this somehting your family did growing up? Actually, here in Spain it was not really a tradition before (it's a German tradition) but I think is a good one to adopt!!
