We have never been a family of giving a lot of gifts for Christmas! Actually, since the last Christmas we have been living in different countries (2017 in Amsterdam, 2016 in Mozambique, 2015 between Gainesvill and Santa Coloma, ...) I could say that we had smaller Christmas than average. We feel like our kids already have a lot and we (the adults) don't want much. And travelling so much makes you realize even more that we don't really need that much!

So, this year, I have been trying to think about meaningful gits, useful things that my family and friends could enjoy, that I could make with my hands, some of them with Ramona's help, and here is a list of some ideas:

**Waldorf window stars**

They are beautiful to decorate your windows, especially when the sun come trough! They are easy and fun to make! We even organized and evening with my girdfriends to make some while listening to Christmas music and drinking hot tea! There are a lot of different ones, from very simple to more complicated and beautiful ones! You can make them small and give them as a complement with your gift wrapping.

To make them you just need:
- the specific beeswax paper (you can find it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mercurius-Assorted-Colors-sheets-Square/dp/B004IORPWU/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545338719&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=beeswax+paper+waldorf+stars" target="_blank">Amazon</a>
or <a href="https://www.demicasaalmundo.com/shop/manualidades-waldorf/1202-bloc-surtido-100-hojas-papel-encerado-para-estrellas-waldorf.html?search_query=papel&results=68" target="_blank">here</a>)
- a glue stick 
- a sharpe knife.

**Beeswax Candels**

Theis is a very easy craft to do with the little ones and such a nice present. Beeswax candles are made out of 100% natural beeswax and they smell so good. Pure Beeswax Candles also burn with almost no smoke and clean the air by releasing negative ions into the air.

To make them you just need:
- 100% beeswax honeycomb sheets
- cotton wick

**Beeswax Christmas tree ornaments**

With the same beeswax sheets and some cookie cutters we made Chrsitmas tree ornaments with Ramona! So simple but so cute, don't you think?

**Lip balm**

We also made our own lip balm, together with Ramona. I really wanted to make my own lip balm for the longest time and finally this year I decided to buy the necessery stuff, which is not much, and try it! And we are relly happy with the result!

To make it we used: 
- Organic Coconut Oil
- Organic beeswax pellets
- Organic Shea butter 
- Essential oils
- Small round tins or other containers

**Essential oils sprays**

I started following this super mama, Rachel from the blog  <a href="https://thetent.com.au/" target="_blank">"The red tent"</a>
and she inspired me so much. 
One of the things I tried from her blog are the "Relaxing Pillow" and the "Daily Stress-Away" Sprays. Learning more about essential oil and discovering this new world is fascinating! So, go check her out, maybe it will inspire you too!

**Granola**

We have been making our own granola for the past 6 months. Almost every week I make a new batch. We love it so much, so simple and so delicious. It is a way to know what you are eating for breakfast and it is a healthier version of the ones you find at the grocery store!
