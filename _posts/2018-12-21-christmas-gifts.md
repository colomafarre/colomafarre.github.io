We have never been a family of giving a lot of gifts for Christmas! Actually, because the last few Christmases we have been living in different countries (2017 in Amsterdam, 2016 in Mozambique, 2015 between the USA and Catalonia, ...) I could say that **we had calmer Christmases than average**. We feel like our kids already have a lot and we (the adults) don't want much (and we have a lot). And travelling so much makes you realize even more that we don't really need anything!!!

So, this year, instead of buying a lot of things, I have been **trying to think of meaningful gifts**, useful things that my family and friends could enjoy, that I could make with my hands, some of them with Ramona's help, and here is a list of 7 ideas:

**1. Waldorf window stars**

They are beautiful to decorate your windows, especially when the sun come trough! They are easy and fun to make! We even organized an evening with my girlfriends to make some while listening to Christmas music and drinking hot tea! There are a lot of different ones, from very simple to more complicated and beautiful ones! You can make them small and give them as a complement with your gift wrapping.

To make them you just need:
- the specific beeswax paper (you can find it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mercurius-Assorted-Colors-sheets-Square/dp/B004IORPWU/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545338719&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=beeswax+paper+waldorf+stars" target="_blank">Amazon</a>
or <a href="https://www.demicasaalmundo.com/shop/manualidades-waldorf/1202-bloc-surtido-100-hojas-papel-encerado-para-estrellas-waldorf.html?search_query=papel&results=68" target="_blank">here</a>)
- a glue stick 
- a sharpe knife.

**2. Beeswax Candels**

Theis is a very easy craft to do with the little ones and such a nice present. Beeswax candles are made out of 100% natural beeswax and they smell so good. Pure Beeswax Candles also burn with almost no smoke and clean the air by releasing negative ions into the air.

To make them you just need:
- 100% beeswax honeycomb sheets
- cotton wick

**3. Beeswax Christmas tree ornaments**

With the same beeswax sheets and some cookie cutters we made Chrsitmas tree ornaments with Ramona! So simple but so cute, don't you think?

**4. Lip balm**

We also made our own lip balm, together with Ramona. I really wanted to make my own lip balm for the longest time and finally this year I decided to buy the necessery stuff, which is not much, and try it! And we are really happy with the result!

To make it we used: 
- Organic Coconut Oil
- Organic beeswax pellets
- Organic Shea butter 
- Essential oils
- Small round tins or other containers

**5. Essential oils sprays**

I started following this super mama, Rachel from the blog  <a href="https://thetent.com.au/" target="_blank">"The red tent"</a>
and she inspired me so much. 
One of the things I tried from her blog are the "Relaxing Pillow" and the "Daily Stress-Away" Sprays. Learning more about essential oils and discovering this new world is fascinating! So, go check her out, maybe it will inspire you too!

**6. Granola**

We have been making our own granola for the past 6 months. Almost every week I make a new batch. We love it so much, so simple and so delicious. It is a way to know what ingredients you are eating and it is a healthier version of the ones you find at the grocery store! We love it for breakfast with yogurt and fruit.

We make it mixing the following ingredients:
- 500gr of oats
- 1 and 1/2 cups of nuts/seeds
- 1 teaspoon od salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
- 1/2 cups of melted coconut oil or olive oil
- 1/2 cups of maple syrup or agave syrupe

And bake it in the oven for about 20-25 min. Give it a try, you are going to love it!

**7. A painting**

Ramona loves painting! And people, especially family members, love having her art hanging in their houses! I bought some blank canvases and when Ramona feels like painting she makes her art. We've used them as birthday gifts too!
