To celebrate **Ramona's first year of life** we wanted to make a video to share with family and friends.

We have sooo many photos and videos of this 1st year with our baby and it can get overwhelming when you try to look back.

We like making short videos with music. We normally do it after our trips or vacations to sum up and make it easier to watch! I may post some others that we have soon.

I hope you like it!
