Living in Nepal feels like you are obligated to do some kind of trekking. This is an amazing place for it, with the beautiful and spectacular Himalayas! We sterted looking into going to an organized 4 day trekking trip from Pokhara, but finally we decided we were going to organize it ourselfs and stay in our district. The idea of 6+ hour car rides with the kids again seamed like a lot and didn't excited us that much...

So, we got together with some friends (4 peace corp volunteers living in our district and some nepali cooworkers too), we rented a jeep that took us half way to our destination, and then we hiked all the way to the end of our district, to this **super remote village named Syauliwang**.

We thought living where we live was very rural and remote, but it was nothing compared to our weekend destination!

We left Friday after an early lunch. We squezed in the jeep, plus 2 motorcylces. We didn't know how the roads where going to be so we didn't know how far they would drive us. After a 3 hour drive, with a stop to eat dal bhat, crossing and drive in rivers (because the road was blocked with) we loaded up our backpacks and started our hike.

The trails where beautiful, going along the mountains, through the forest, following up the river, the air was getting cooler,

It was a constant switching backpacs and carrying kids in different ways but we made it work. Ramona walked some, she also went in the basket, in the shoulders and Galileo too, in the carrier, in Joe's shoulders, etc. So greatful for friends helping out too!! It takes a village!

After about 3 hours walking, with some mandatory breaks to eat snacks and swim in the river, we reached our destination! Having no expectations on what it will look like sure make for a big surprise upon arrival. The village was located in a beautiful valley, sorounded by green mountains with balcony rice fields (com es diu aixo)

We stayed in this 'hotel' (explain situation, dinner...)

The town was really cute, very different from what we are used too! The houses where very rustic, built for the cold weather, with low silings, (explain_)

The next morning, some brave ones ventured to climb to the highest ... while me and the kids wondered around town, making new friends and peting all the animals.

Swimming in the cold river was one of the most memorable moments of the trip for me. Seeing Ramona get in the ice cold water and Galileo so happy througing rocks in it! The best!
