This post is a little bit embarrassing for me but my husband thought it was a good idea and he insisted (forced) me to write it, and he normally has good ideas, so, here we go.

Two years ago, when we were living in Gainesville, I was working at a Waldorf school, and for my birthday, one of my colleages, got me some watercolor paintings and paper. Every week at school the students will paint and I really liked their creations, so I decided to start painting to.

I started trying, practicing different technics, painting little drawings and framing them, some for our house, some as gifts for friends. It was really fun and such a creative way to spend my free time! I loved it and I wish I had more time to learn more, but for the moment, it's just fun to play with the paints and create. Just create. It's relaxing and fulfilling for me!
