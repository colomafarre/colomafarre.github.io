**We all know how difficult it is to find time to exercise. Especially when you have a baby**. Finding time for the bare minimum (sleeping, eating, going to the bathroom) is hard enough, and things like exercise can seem like a second thought. The main problem is that exercise time (going to the gym, running, etc.) is generally separate from family time (playing, etc.). And when you're forced to choose between one or the other, it's usually the exercise time that loses. But it doesn't have to be this way.

We found ourselves complaining about how little time we had all together, while also wanting get in better shape! So we came up with a solution: combining exercise time and family time. **We decided to start working out as a family**!

We work out 3 times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday). **In Barcelona** we use to do it in the afternoon, after Joe's work. We would go to a big park close to our apartment that had a big structure that was perfect to do pull-ups and other exercises. And it also had a fenced sand box where Ramona could entertain herself and play with other kids.

Here **in Mozambique** we do it in the morning, before it gets too hot. There aren't parks here, so we do it in our yard. But our yard is full of sand, full of kids (all the neighbors are always over), and we've built some park-like structures (pull-up bars, a swing, etc.). So, it's basically a park.

The idea is that **we work out at the same time**, but kind of take turns playing with Ramona or watching her while she explores or has a snack. **Going back and forth between exercise and baby-watching is actually pretty efficient**, since after a hard set of push-ups you need some rest time anyway. She loves crawling on top of my when I am trying to do my crunches or planks and it makes it harder but more fun. Also, just this week, she has started to like running. We go "3, 2, 1, go" and she starts "running" and giggling.

It may take slightly more time to do the workout like this than if we do it on our own, but it is more entertaining. And we have found that this works best for us. We exercise while spending **good quality time together as a family**! It is also a good example for Ramona to see her parents doing something healthy while having fun. She even started copying us with some exercises, and when we say the word "exercise" now, she lays on the floor and starts doing "push-ups" (which is super adorable).

Here is **a silly video** we made showing some moments of our family workouts. I hope that you like it and maybe that it will inspire you to try it with your family!
