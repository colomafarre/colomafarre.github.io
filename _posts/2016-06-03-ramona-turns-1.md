On May 29th 2016 Ramona turned 1. One year being parents, learning from her and with her. We celebrated together with my family and some friends, having a picnic style party after walking/biking to this little church yard 30 minutes away from my hometown.

I made her little birthday cake following a recipe from the blog "fit mama real food", perfect banana cake without added sugar that Ramona really LOVED!!!
