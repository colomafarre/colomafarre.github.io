On May 29th, 2016 Ramona turned 1. One year being parents, learning from her and with her. We celebrated together with my family and some friends, having a picnic style party after walking/biking to this little church yard 30 minutes away from my hometown. Everybody brought something to snack on, we brought drinks and fruit, people got sweet gifts for her, kisses and love.

I made her little birthday cake following a recipe from the blog <a href="http://www.fitmamarealfood.com/babys-first-smash-cake-healthy-no-sugar-banana-cake/" target="_blank">"Fit mama real food"</a>. Perfect banana cake without added sugar decorated with blueberries that Ramona really LOVED!!! She first ate all the blueberries and then dipped her fingers in the frosting! So sweet!

I also made her birthday crown, with the help of my grandma (Ramona's great grandma)! The cool thing about it is that the number is interchangeable so I will be able to use it for her next birthdays!

It was a beautiful afternoon outdoors, surrounded by people we love. Ramona had the best time, she was happy and enjoying every minute of it! She is so loved! Thanks everyone!
