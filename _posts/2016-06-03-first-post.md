Hello! Welcome to my blog. My name is Coloma. This is the space I created to share things with all of you! Family, friends, people from here, people from over there...

My first language is Catalan but I am gonna write in English like this I can reach to more people.  On May 29th 2016 Ramona turned 1. One year being parents, learning from her and with her. We celebrated together with my family and some friends, having a picnic style party after walking/biking to this little church yard 30 minutes from my town.

I made her little birthday cake following a recipe from the blog "fit mama real food", perfect banana cake without added sugar that Ramona really LOVED!!!
