Hello! Welcome to our blog. My name is Coloma. I'll be writing most of the post. Occasionally Joe, my husband, will too. This is the space we created to share things with all of you! Family, friends, people from here, people from over there...

My first language is Catalan. I decided to write in English so I could reach more of you! It will be good for me to keep improving my English and for those of you that English is not your first language either can be good practice too, right? We are always learning!! SO forgive me if there are any mistakes...

The idea is to share a little bit of our lives here. We thought it would be nice, now that we are gonna move overseas to such a different "world" which is Manhiça, a town in Mozambique, to be able to show you what it's like to live there and how are things going for us!

Thank you for reading! And please fill free to leave comments and tell us what you think about all this ;)
