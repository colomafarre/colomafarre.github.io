At the en of September we went for 5 days to Amsterdam. My husband had a work conference there and we took advantatge of it to enjoy it as a family. I lived in Holland before, in 2009 during my Erasmus semester, in Utrecht, 20 minutes train ride from Amsterdam, and I loved it! I love the people there and the fact that everybody rides bikes everywhere!! It's like a dream!

This time we stayed in an AirBnB in the Pijp neighborhood in Amsterdam. Such a cool place, we where very close to a big and beautiful park (Sarphatipark) with a really nice playground and lake with ducks. There were a lot of hip restaurants and stores and the Albert Cuypmarkt (the biggest and most popular outdoor market in the Netherlands) very close by too.

We did go to Utrecht for one afternoon to visit some friends that live there! It's such a nice city, much more relaxed and calm than Amsterdam! We can't decide which one we like better.

We loved the time there. It was great the fact that almost every restaurant or cafe was family friendly, with a little corner with wooden toys or books for the kids to play with! It was so fun to rent bikes and ride around the center with Ramona! She liked riding in front of the bike (in Barcelona her bike sit is behind Joe's and I think she can't see as much). It was funny buying baby food there and realizing how different the combinations were and the different ingredients they use that you'll never find in spanish baby food like: beef+apples+beans,or fish+pasta+spinach.

Here are some of my favourite pictures of those days!
