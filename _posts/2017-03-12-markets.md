Going to the market in Mozambique is **an experience for all the senses**.

<a href="/img/markets/IMG_8005.jpg"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/IMG_8005.jpg" width="200"></a>

In Manhiça, for example, there's **one big supermarket** where you can find almost everything - but that's not where normal people buy because it's much more expensive. We go there onces a week to buy bottled water, refrigerated stuff like yogurt and fruit that come from South Africa, and "fancy stuff" like cheese, canned black beans, frozen pizzas or ice cream. And then there are **several different street markets and stores**, mostly on the main road, and that's where you can find what Mozambicans grow in their "machambas" (their word for plot of land), clothes, shoes, etc.

**Fruits and vegetables** are normally sold on the outskirts of towns, next to the road, under some trees. Women gather, spread their products, beautifully piled and organized by groups (they sell by "servings", not by weight or quantity) and spend all day there.

When you stop with the car they all run to you to try to sell you what they have! **It can be really overwhelming**!!

In the **town markets** you can find mostly all the basic stuff (not refrigerated), from vegetables, bread and pasta, to backpacks, [capulanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capulana){:target="_blank"} (the typical Mozambican sarong) and flip-flops.

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6477.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6477.JPG" width="200"></a> Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, potatoes and green peppers are the basic vegetables you can find in most of the stands.

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6515.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6515.JPG" width="200"></a> One loaf of bread is 5 Meticais (7 cents of dollar)

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6516.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6516.JPG" width="200"></a> Sellers spend all day at the market. They eat there and even take naps.

You can also have a hot meal.

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6535.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6535.JPG" width="200"></a> Those big packages are 10kg sacks of rice. Rice is one of the main foods for the people in Mozambique!

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6522.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6522.JPG" width="200"></a> Little stands where you can buy everything from cookies and candy to notebooks with a Beyonce or Messi cover.

Shopping for capulanas is so much fun! But not easy!! There are so many patterns and colors!! I use them to have clothes made for me and Ramona, as well as bags, purses, etc.

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6501.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6501.JPG" width="200"></a> I bought a pare of flip-flops for 90 Meticais (a little bit more than 1 Euro!)

<a href="/img/markets/0000_IMG_6506.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/markets/0000_IMG_6506.JPG" width="200"></a> We go very often to the market so Ramona already made a friend there :)

So, **some of the positive things about going grocery shopping in Mozambique**, compared to Spain, for example, is the ambiance, the direct contact with the seller, who is often also the grower, the friendliness, and the fact that you can buy fresh stuff without spending too much. But, **the negative side** is that there's not much variety of food. And it's very seasonal so that means that when it's mango and papaya season, the only fruits you can buy are mangos and papayas! And I know that is supposed to be very good but, for those of us used to an unnaturally huge variety of food all year round it can be difficult to feel satisfied.

And to finish, **a video compilation of different trips to buy groceries** with Ramona.
