Hello! Welcome to our blog. My name is Coloma. I'll be writing most of the posts. Occasionally Joe, my husband, will too. This is a space we created to share things with all of you! Family, friends, people from here, people from over there...

My first language is Catalan. I decided to write in English so I could reach more of you! It will be good for me to keep improving my English and for those of you for whom English is not your first language either, this can be good practice too, right? We are always learning!! So forgive me if there are any mistakes...

The idea is to share a little bit of our lives here. We thought it would be nice, since we are moving from country to country over the next few years (Mozambique, Spain, Holland), to be able to show you what it's like to live there and how are things going for us!

Thank you for reading! And please fill free to leave comments and tell us what you think about all this ;)
