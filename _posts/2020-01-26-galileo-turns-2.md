On January 21st 2020, Galileo turned 2. Two times around the sun! He has grown so much the last year.

It has been such an interesting second year of his short life! Spending the first half of it in Nepal and the second in Catalonia. Learning to walk in rural Nepal and starting talking in rural Catalonia. Travelling to the USA to spend Christmas with his American family. He sure has seen a lot this year!
