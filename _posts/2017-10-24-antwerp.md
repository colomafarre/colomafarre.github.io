Last week we took a family try to **Antwerp, Belgium** (1 hour and 15 minutes by train from Amsterdam). Joe had to attend a Tropical Medicine Conference there and me and Ramona decided to join the fun and take advantage of it to discover a new city.

**We spent the days like this**: waking up around 7:30, snuggling in bed for a while, having breakfast at the hotel buffet, going out to discover something new in the city (Zoo, museum, shops, etc), having a small lunch, going back to the hotel for a nap,

having a snack at the plaza in front of the hotel and spending the afternoon at the beautiful Stadspark, waiting for Joe to be done with his work day and then finding a restaurant to have dinner together.  It was a nice week of a lot of walking around, eating good chocolate and other yummy treats! Not bad!

We took the train to get there and it was a very good decision. Very fast, convenient and comfortable to travel with a toddler that likes to move around!

**Great things you shouldn't miss if you visit Antwerp**:

**1. The <a href="https://www.zooantwerpen.be/en/" target="_blank">Zoo</a>!**

Antwerp Zoo is located next to the Antwerpen-Centraal train station. It is the oldest animal park in the country, and one of the oldest in the world, established on 21 July 1843. Very nice to spend a day outside! I am not a fan of animals in captivity but the different set ups and exhibits were very neat and beautifully arranged. Worth seeing.

Ramona's favorite spot was the aquarium! She was fascinated by all the water and the dim blue light.

There is a nice restaurant with some warm meals and also quick lunches if you want a grab a bite to eat. And great playgrounds for the little ones to climb and play for a while too.

**2. The parks!**

We especially enjoyed **the Stadspark**, a big and beautiful park close to the Central Station too. The fall colors were everywhere and the playground was amazing! Ramona had a lot of fun!

**3. The <a href="http://www.mas.be/en" target="_blank">MAS Museum</a>!**

<a href="/img/antwerp/0000_IMG_6516.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/antwerp/0000_IMG_6516.JPG" width="200"></a>

This museum has different exhibits but also, without having to pay, you can climb to the top of the building and have an amazing panoramic view of the city!

We didn't choose the best morning to go beacuse it was kind of foggy, but still nice to see!!

<a href="/img/antwerp/0000_IMG_6557.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/antwerp/0000_IMG_6557.JPG" width="200"></a> Ramona loved running around the huge terrace!

**4. Walk around the cathedral**

<a href="/img/antwerp/0000_IMG_6569.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/antwerp/0000_IMG_6569.JPG" width="200"></a>

The streets and plazas around the cathedral are really charming, full of nice restaurants, stores and buildings. Worth getting lost and a perfect place to get some good chocolate and cookies!
