"**Life is like riding a bicycle.To keep your balance you must keep moving.**" - Albert Einstein

Bicycles are amazing. They're fast. They're great exercise. They're environmentally friendly. And they're so fun. Every time I ride a bike, I feel like a kid again. It's like a video game, but in real life.

Coloma rode her bike all through pregnancy.

And when her belly got so large that it was no longer comfortable, we rode our "bakfiets" (big, Dutch box-bicycle) together as a family.

Along came Ramona. Fortunately, babies love bikes.

Nowadays, we don't ride as much (Barcelona being a very walkable city). But when we do, Ramona loves it.

A year ago, we took Ramona (who was 4.5 months old) on her **first bike trip**. We went through the Ocala National Forest to meet some friends of ours for a camping trip. It was amazing and beautiful, and even though the trip was interrupted by a campsite visit from some black bears, it's one of our fondest memories of Florida.

Bikes. Fuck yeah.
