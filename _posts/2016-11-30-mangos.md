What should you do **if you have way too many mangos**? That may not be a problem you had before or will ever have, and I am telling you that I never had this issue before in my life either. But, right now, that is our situation: a big yard with 5 huge mango trees and now it's mango season, so, that means we have about 100 mangos a day (that is Joe's estimation)!!

Here is what we do:

  - First of all, be careful! Mangos are actually pretty heavy. If you happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, you may get hurt. Even Ramona has learned to say **"boom"** every time a mango hits the ground, which is pretty often!

  - Collect mangos every morning and throughout the day and **select the good ones** (there's a lot that are half eaten by birds, etc), wash them and stick them in the fridge.

  - **Eat mangos all day long**. For breakfast, for dessert and for snack!

  - We give some to our **neighbors** across the street. But then they give us some back because they have a different kind of tree that makes very good mangos too! So we end up with same amount or more!!

  - Every once in a while there are **kids** coming in the yard to ask if they can pick up some mangos. "Yes!!" The other day, 2 came in to ask and the moment I said "yes" there were like 6 more that came in, they started climbing the trees and throwing rocks to make the mangos fall! It was amazing how good they were at it!

  - We will bring some as gifts for **friends** or when people invite us over for dinner.

  - I thought about making **dried mango** but then I read that you have to use the oven for 1 or 2 hours and our house is hot enough these days... Maybe if there's a cooler day I will try...

  - I made **mango jam**!

  I never made jam before, but I decided I wanted to make some so I called my mom for advice and I did. Without following any specific recipe, without measuring the ingredients, I just improvised a little bit and it turned out quite good.

Well, it's hard to say, because I've never tried mango jam before either so I don't have anything with which to compare it ... But the whole family enjoyed it for breakfast with some french toast and both Joe and Ramona approved!

Now, the plan is to make more jam soon. Any other ideas? :P
