This past weekend some friends invited us to go to **Zongoene Lodge**, about 3 hours north of Manhiça. First it sounded like too much for a weekend with a baby, but we are so happy we went. It was great! Relaxing, swimming, eating good food and enjoying time with our new friends.

It's a special place situated where the river meets the sea. The second half of the trip there was all on extremely bumpy, unpaved roads which passed through several tiny villages.

We arrived there Friday evening. We were a big group so we stayed in different little houses. Ours was the big one so that we could hang out at night together with our friends while having Ramona sleep close enough to hear.

Saturday morning activities: exploring nature, walking to the river, discovering new plants and animals, and pool.

After lunch we took a family nap (the best!) and then there was a little boat waiting to take us to the other side of the river, to this beach.

What a place! **It was like being on a different planet**! So cool! So different than what I had imagined! Big, open, super windy beach! In order to protect us from the wind, we made a little fort with our stuff and a big log. We walked around looking for shells, we kept some to make a mobile for Ramona's room (like the one in her favorite bed time story book, "Ten, night, eight").

But the best was when we walked all the way to the water, there was a drop-off so you couldn't see it until you were very close but, at the shore there were crabs, **so many crabs**! It was magical!

And here they are, **jumping pictures** are back! I use to take them all the time, I don't know what happened, but in case you missed them... ;)

<a href="/img/zongoene/IMG_0426.JPG"> <img border="0" alt="Caption goes here" src = "/img/zongoene/IMG_0426.JPG" width = "200"></a> And Ramona "jumps"!

**The sky there was amazing**! So many stars! Even the moon looked gorgeous! It was the first time we saw the moon since we moved to Mozambique and Ramona got all excited! She even says "lluna" (moon in Catalan) now, kind of! And every time she sees a star now she wants us to sing "Twinkle twinkle little star" (to which she dances), so imagine how many times we sang it this weekend!!

Sunday we spent the day doing more of the same, exploring, snacking, chilling, swimming and relaxing!

On the way back **it was amazing to see the landscapes around**. On the way there it was so dark that we couldn't see anything. But on the way back we could see all sorts of animals, tiny villages with kids playing, moms cooking outside, little markets, small bars with men hanging out. Very entertaining and beautiful.

Ramona slept for half of the trip (just like on the way there) on our lap. We stopped half way in a big street market to buy vegetables, fruits and yummy roasted cashews.

Zongone is a great place to go either with family or with friends (or with both, like we did), very kid friendly, to relax but also with fun stuff to do. Some of our friends rented 4X4s to go to the lighthouse and they said it was very cool!

I hope you had a nice weekend too!
