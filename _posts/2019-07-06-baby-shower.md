Soon I am going to become an aunty! My sister is 37 weeks pregnant and I can't wait to meet baby Teo. Being away from her while in Nepal, knowing that she was pregnant with her first baby, was hard! But it gave me time think ideas and prepare her baby shower!

We got together at my grandma's patio, at 6 pm, to enjoy some crafts and treats together. Maria's friends were invited, and also family. We got organized so people will bring things to eat and drink. Here is what we had:

To eat:
- Cut out fruit (watermelon, mango and bananas)
- Chocolate crispies
- Apple tart
- Little chocolate puffs

To drink:
- Fresh orange juice
- Mint lemonade
- Coffee

Then, knowing that my sister was not very into "typical baby shower games" and more into handcrafted stuff, we worked on 3 activities togetehr. 

The first one was **making flower crowns** with natural flowers. All we needed was:

- Flowers and foliage
- Green tape
- Wire
- Scissors and wire cutters

I kind of showed them how to make one and everyone worked on their own little creatin! They turned out beautiful!

<a href="/img/babyshower/IMG_6224.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/babyshower/IMG_6224.JPG" width="200"></a>She was not the only pregnant one!


<a href="/img/babyshower/IMG_6232.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/babyshower/IMG_6232.JPG" width="200"></a>Everyone enjoyed the yummy treats, even the little ones!

Once every one had their flower crown ready we moved on to the next crafts. Some of us made **colorful bracelets with thread**, remembering the summers as little girls, making friendship bracelets of all sorts of colors and patterns!

The rest sat down and concentrated to work on some cute but hard to make **elephant origami to creat a cute mobile for the babies room** like this one:

**To decorate the patio**, I hanged some felted rainbow flags that I got in Nepal and some baby pictures of Maria and Jose, the future parents, so we could see what baby Teo is going to look like!

It was a very relaxed and beuatiful baby shower. We all had fun and spend a great afternoon/evening with people we love learning to make things with our hands. What is better?
