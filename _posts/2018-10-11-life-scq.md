It has been almost a month since Ramona started school after a long summer break. She started at the big kids school (how she calls it!) mid September. So **our family rhythm** has switch from a late and relaxed summer schedule, that included a lot of time outside, specially in the evenings, late bed times and slow breakfasts, to a more structured and early rhythm. So, here is **what our day to day looks like now**. (Very different too from our normal day in Mozambique 2 years ago! Have a look <a href="http://familyonthego.life/life/">here</a>)

**We wake up at 8 in the morning**, the latest. Ramona sleeps trough the night in her own room, but Galileo still wakes up multiple times during the night so he is still in our room. We have **breakfast** together, alternating oatmeal, cereal and homemade granola, with fruit, yougurt or milk. Then I pack Ramona's snack for school, we get dressed and out of the door by 8:50 to **drop off Ramona at school**. Joe works from home most of the time but somedays he has to go to Barcelona, then he leaves at 6 am and comes back around 5 pm.

On Mondays I go to the **market** to buy fruits and vegetables for the week, some olives and a roasted chicken that we eat for lunch. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I take a **fitness class**. Galileo comes with me and plays on a mat in a corner while I sweat and get strong! On Wednesdays and Fridays I try to catch up on **laundry and housework** stuff. Mid morning Galileo takes a nap. At 12 we pick up Ramona from school, which is a 5 minutes walk from home. The idea is that Ramona will stay at school for lunch and nap 2 days a week, but we are still working on it.

We eat **lunch** together around 12:20, then Ramona takes a nap from 1 to 2:30. I clean the kitchen and play with Galileo. Joe goes back to work. I wake Ramona up at 2:30 to get ready to go to school again. I walk her with Galileo in the carrier so he may fall asleep.

I go back home and **while Galileo naps** I work on whaterver I am working at the moment (blog post, neddle felting, making granola, ...). At 5 pm I pick up Ramona from school. I bring her a snack and she eats it with her friends. Then we go to the park or plaça for a while. I buy whatever I need for dinner. 

<a href="/img/lifescq/0000_20180924_175637.JPG"> <img border="0" src= "/img/lifescq/0000_20180924_175637.JPG" width="200"></a>

Around 6:30 (it's getting earlier by the day now because afternoons are getting shorter and it's getting colder outside) we go home. I prepare dinner. Ramona either helps me in the kitchen or has some free play time. We eat dinner together at around 7:30-8 pm. Right after dinner starts the **bed time routine**: bath, teeth, pjs, stories and bed time. Galileo and Ramona take a bath togheter. Then I take one kid and Joe takes the other to dry and put pjs on. I breastfeed Galileo to sleep and Joe tells 1,000 stories to Ramona and helps her fall asleep. 

Both kids are normaly asleep by 9-9:30. Then we clean the dinner mess and we have some **quiet time for us**. We either finish some work, watch a tv show or talk and plan our lives!

On **weekends our rhythm is more relaxed**! We have slower mornings with pjs on and long breakfasts. We go to my avia's house (my grandma) for lunch together with my parents, we do hikes and adventure walks, we hang out at the bar on the plaça while Ramona rides her bike around, we do things with friends, etc.

On Sundays I do the **meal planing**. I write down what we are going to have for lunch and dinner so I know what to buy on Monday. I find it very helpful so I don't have to think every day "What am I gonna make for dinner tonight!?".

I like our days like this. It is true that having to rush out of the house in the morning to go to school can be a little bit stressful some days but I do think **this rhythm is good for our family**! 

Is yours very different to ours? 

I also want to share a list of activities I have in mind to do during this season:


**Fall bucket list activities**:

- Mushroom hunting
- Chestnut picking
- Nature walk with basket for colecting treasures
- Create a fall nature table 
- Knit hats for the kids
- Bake something together
- Watch a movie + pop corn under the blankets
- Bake panellets (see how to make those <a href="http://familyonthego.life/fall/">here</a> )
- Bake apple crumble pie
- Make Mimi's coconut curry pumpkin soup
- Make a fort on a rainy day

What else should I add ??
