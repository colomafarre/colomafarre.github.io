This fall is special for us. Special because it's going to be shorter than normal and I think that makes us enjoy it more! Fall is not usually my favorite season, but the fact that we'll be moving to Mozambique in a few weeks (where summer is just around the corner) is making me want to savor every moment and feel every fall feeling!

The other weekend we did a little hike with our friends after a big lunch. We took a basket to collect "fall treasures" on the way. Hiking with toddlers is not the same as without them. The amount of time it takes to get from point A to point B is muuuccchh longer than it used to be. Stopping every few meters, taking more breaks, inexplicable melt-downs, falls, diaper changes, etc. But the slow speed really helps you to appreciate the little things.

So nice to spend time outside, with friends, seeing the world through Ramona's eyes! She is now in a stage where she notices every little sound and detail and it's so cute to see her reactions to new things!

She is also starting to communicate more. She learned how to say "no", for example, but she is not really using it right. Halfway through the hike I asked her if she wanted an apple and she emphatically said "no". I gave it to her just in case and she didn't let go of it for an hour! She nibbled on it all the way back home!

And more pictures of another beautiful fall day. Playing with the fallen leaves!

After collecting our fall treasures, I arranged a little corner at home to display them so that Ramona can play with them. She loves throwing the chestnuts on the floor, as far as possible, and putting the little acorns inside their "hats".

And finally, we wanted to share a video too! We made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panellets" target="_blank">"panellets"</a>, the typical Catalan dessert for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castanyada" target="_blank">"la Castanyada"</a> and here is the process! We had a lot of fun making them. Ramona helped a lot (not really), but she at least entertained the bakers. Enjoy!!
